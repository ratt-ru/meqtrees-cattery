# meqtrees-cattery

The Cattery is a set of MeqTrees-based frameworks for simulation and calibration of 
radio interferometers. Pretty much everything is done via a Cattery package these
days.

Cattery bugs should be reported via the main MeqTrees repository here:

https://github.com/ska-sa/meqtrees/issues

MeqTrees is a software package for implementing Measurement Equations.
This makes it uniquely suited for simulation and calibration of
radioastronomical data, especially that involving new radiotelescopes and
observational regimes.

## Installation

```
 $ python setup.py install
```
